# MemorizeGame

A memorization card game built using SwiftUI. This game, also known as Matching Pairs or
Concentration, is played with a set of cards face down and the user picks two cards per turn. The
goal is to pick two cards of matching
emojis in each turn. Some new features in this version include giving bonus points for quick
matching, fun animations, and the ability to customize the cards by adding new themes and emojis.
